# LLM/RAG-based Movie Recommendation System
## Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system that utilizes three distinct recommendation techniques to deliver a comprehensive and personalized user experience.

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to suggest products, content, or services based on user preferences and behaviors. They analyze data such as past interactions, ratings, and user profiles to predict what users may enjoy. Common techniques include collaborative filtering, which leverages similarities between users or items, and content-based filtering, which recommends items similar to those a user has previously liked based on their features. Recommender systems are widely employed across various domains, including e-commerce, streaming services, and social media, to enhance user experience and engagement.

In this project, we will explore different approaches to build a movie recommendation system:

1. **Collaborative Filtering**: This method recommends movies based on user interactions and preferences. By analyzing patterns and similarities among users, the system identifies movies enjoyed by others with similar tastes, making personalized suggestions based on collective user behavior.

2. **Content-Based Recommendation**: The system also offers content-based recommendations, focusing on movie attributes. It analyzes features such as genre and tags to suggest movies that align with the user's specific interests and preferences.

3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: By combining document retrieval from a vector store with large language models, RAG enhances recommendations by fetching relevant information from a database and generating context-aware suggestions. This allows the system to provide recommendations that are both contextually relevant and tailored to user queries.
